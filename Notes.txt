Add wishlists (probably a good idea to make a new model with a one-to-one relationship with CustomUser)
Add user filter for searching
Improve participants selection when creating event
Also good idea to include search for host and celebrant in the create event form
Implement Google Authorization
Include profile pictures from Google
In case there are multiple envets requiring an alert email - send one email for all, not one for each event.
Logging
Write some tests
