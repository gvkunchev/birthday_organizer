Additional notes:
1. Wishlists ideas / requirements
  - The wishlist items can be marked as "gifted" and as a consequence "archived" (in a section called "Treasure Hoard" in the wishlist view) after the event
  - (Nice to have) BO should remind the user a 4-3-2 weeks before his birthday in case his/hers wishlist is empty
  - (Nice to have) The people in the event should be able to vote for a specific item in the wishlist
  - There should be a visual difference when "deactivating" an item in the wishlist
